      //- Use the Pug `each` iterator to loop over the projects in your data file  
      each project in projects
      
        //- Use the example Pug code below and interpolated template literals as needed to dynamically generate:
          //- The paths in the link's href and img's src attributes
          //- The text 'Thumbnail' interpolated with the project title for the img's alt attribute
          //- The project title for the h5 element's text

        .cell
          a(href=`/project/${project.id}`, target='_blank')
            img.thumbnail(src=`../images/project-${project.id + 1}-img-1`, alt=`screenshot of ${project.project_name}`)
            h5 #{project.project_name}
